# Film-service
this web application allows the user to view information about movies, series and actors.
Content information come from The Movie Database API.

In this project I used:
+ React;
+ react-create-app;
+ redux, react-redux;
+ react-router;
+ react hooks;
+ TMDb API;

You can run this project locally just do:
